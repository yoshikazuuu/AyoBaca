**An engaging iOS application designed to empower children with dyslexia in Indonesia, transforming reading challenges into fun, inclusive, and hopeful learning adventures through smart digital technology and innovative methods.**

---

## üéØ Problem Background

Reading is a fundamental skill, yet a significant portion of children face challenges. In Indonesia:

*   Approximately **10%** of school-aged children experience dyslexia.
*   Over **60%** of teachers may lack a full understanding of dyslexia.
*   Less than **30%** of affected children receive appropriate support.
*   High therapy costs and limited access, especially in remote areas, leave much potential untapped.

Furthermore, the International Dyslexia Association estimates that **15-20%** of the world's population exhibits symptoms of dyslexia to varying degrees. These children don't need labels; they need understanding and effective tools.
